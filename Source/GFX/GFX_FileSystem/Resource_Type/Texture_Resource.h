		Texture Resource Specifications:
			1) You can use textures to just read on GPU (probably for object material rendering), read-write on GPU (using compute shader to write an image), render target (framebuffer attachment)
			2) Modern APIs let you use a texture in anyway, it's left for your care. But OpenGL doesn't let this situation, you are defining your texture's type in creation proccess
			3) GFX_API doesn't do any checks for type safety, so it's up to you! That means it's possible to access a read-only buffer as a write buffer in a shader
			4) If Has_Mipmaps is true, mipmap generation is triggered on the GPU (Want to support uploading mipmaps in future).
			5) If OP_TYPE is CPUEXISTENCE_xxx, you have to upload texture data in GFXContentManager->Create_Texture. You shouldn't call GFXContentManager->Upload_Texture()

		Texture Types:
			1) Sampler Texture
				a) This is a read only texture for GPU (Object material rendering etc). TEXTURE_TYPEs enum should be either COLOR_TEXTURE or OPACITY_TEXTURE
				b) OP_TYPE should be either CPUEXISTENCE_GPUREADONLY or CPUREADWRITE_GPUREADONLY
			2) Image Texture
				a) This is a read-write texture for GPU, but not a framebuffer attachment
				b) TEXTURE_TYPEs: COLOR_TEXTURE or OPACITY_TEXTURE
				c) OP_TYPEs: CPUEXISTENCE_GPUREADWRITE, CPUREADWRITE_GPUREADWRITE, CPUREAD_GPUREADWRITE
				d) TEXTURE_CHANNELs: ***** WRITE THESE
			3) Render Target Texture
				a) This texture is used as framebuffer attachment for hardware rasterization
				b) TEXTURE_TYPEs: COLORRT_TEXTURE, DEPTHTEXTURE, DEPTHSTENCIL
				c) OP_TYPEs: CPUEXISTENCE_GPUREADWRITE, CPUREADWRITE_GPUREADWRITE, CPUREAD_GPUREADWRITE
				d) TEXTURE_CHANNELs: ***** WRITE_THESE
